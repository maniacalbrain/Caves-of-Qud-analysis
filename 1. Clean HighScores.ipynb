    "I started by taking a copy of the HighScores.vcd file (may appear as a .dat file), opening it with Notepad (PSPad will open it in the hex editor) and saving it as HighScores.txt. Manually I delete everything down as far as the first occurance of ===, this looks something like: Assembly-CSharp\u0005\u0001\u0013XRL.Core.Scoreboard\u0001\u0006Scores\u0003�\u0001System.Collections.Generic.List`1[[XRL.Core.ScoreEntry, Assembly-CSharp....\n",

    "There are a number of symbols which will prevent the file being read into ipython fully or will cause trouble when writing the data to file and these need to be deleted manually as well. These symbols are included in notes.txt, which should be opened in Notepad, and these can be removed by using Edit -> Replace. There is also a circle shape that needs to be removed, which can be hard to find. This is usually the symbol for the bits that make up an artifact, so it may be best to delete everything between a < >. If going through this code using your own highscores you may have to manually delete more lines or symbols.\n",
